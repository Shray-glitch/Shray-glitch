# 👋 Hi, I'm Shray

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm currently learning and building projects in **quantitative finance** and **C++ algorithms**.

## 🧠 What I'm Working On

- 🔢 **Quantitative Finance**: Exploring mathematical finance models, option pricing, and simulations using Python.
- 🧮 **C++ Mastery**: Strengthening my DSA and language fundamentals in C++ for better problem-solving.
- 🎮 **Tekken 7**: Playing with a controller (always down for a good fight!).
